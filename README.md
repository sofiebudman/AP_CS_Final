# Epidemic Simulator
Final project
Sofie Budman & Tyler Tachiki
AP CS period 5

## Background

Welcome to CATCH IT IF YOU CAN!

This epidemic simulator models the spread of a custom-designed virus. See how your virus will spread across the world and see if humanity will be able to respond!

On the next page, you can set virus parameters to control how quickly the virus spreads and mutates and how deadly it will be.

Once you start the simulation, you will also be able to quarantine regions of the world by closing their borders. But beware! Closing a region's borders will cut off key supplies, leading to population decline from starvation.

You will be able to monitor charts throughout the simulation to see how populations are affected by the virus.

Stay Strong!


## VSCode Setup Instructions

1. Install Required Extensions:
   - Install "Extension Pack for Java" in VSCode
   - Install "Processing for Java" extension

2. Project Setup:
   - Open the project folder in VSCode
   - Make sure all the required libraries are in the `lib` folder:
     - core.jar
     - controlP5.jar
     - G4P.jar

3. Resource Files:
   - Ensure all resource files are in the correct locations:
     - Images should be in `src/main/resources/elements/`
     - Map images should be in `src/main/resources/images/`

4. Running the Project:
   - Open `MySketch1.java` (the main sketch file)
   - Click the "Run" button in VSCode
   - If you get any errors about missing Processing libraries, make sure the libraries are properly referenced in the `.classpath` file

5. Troubleshooting:
   - If you get "package processing.core does not exist" errors, make sure the Processing libraries are properly linked
   - If images don't load, check that all resource files are in the correct directories
   - Make sure you're using Java 8 or later
