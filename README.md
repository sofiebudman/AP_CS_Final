## VSCode Setup Instructions

1. Install Required Extensions:
   - Install "Extension Pack for Java" in VSCode
   - Install "Processing for Java" extension

2. Project Setup:
   - Open the project folder in VSCode
   - Make sure all the required libraries are in the `lib` folder:
     - core.jar
     - controlP5.jar
     - G4P.jar

3. Resource Files:
   - Ensure all resource files are in the correct locations:
     - Images should be in `src/main/resources/elements/`
     - Map images should be in `src/main/resources/images/`

4. Running the Project:
   - Open `MySketch1.java` (the main sketch file)
   - Click the "Run" button in VSCode
   - If you get any errors about missing Processing libraries, make sure the libraries are properly referenced in the `.classpath` file

5. Troubleshooting:
   - If you get "package processing.core does not exist" errors, make sure the Processing libraries are properly linked
   - If images don't load, check that all resource files are in the correct directories
   - Make sure you're using Java 8 or later

Note: This project was originally developed in Processing IDE. While it can run in VSCode, you might need to adjust some paths or configurations if you encounter issues.
